Be specific when calling sits, not just “Admin to me!” or “RDM”. If you put detail into your report it is more likely to be noticed and taken by a staff member.

 
Spamming admin chat chat with useless sits, or asking non-game related questions will result in a 5 minute mute, and if done after that a 1 day ban.

 
If you leave your own sit, FOR ANY REASON, the case will be closed and the player in question will not be punished.

 
The accuser has to provide evidence that the other person broke the rules, not the defendant.

 
If the accuser wants defendant punished (and he/she broke the rule) staff reserve the right to reduce their jail time by up to 60 seconds (down to 240 seconds).

 
If the accuser calls a sit and didn’t want the person punished, the defendant will ALWAYS receive a warning, this is to keep up with players who actively break rules.

 
If the accuser does not want the defendant punish the staff member is still allowed to punish him as he/she sees fit.

 
 
                                                                                              Section 1b - Staff Warnings

 
When you are warned by a staff member, you did something wrong. You will typically be jailed alongside a warn unless the person who made the report asks for just the warn.

 
A single warn will stay active for up to two hours.

If you get three (3) consecutive warns in a two hour period, the server automatically will kick you.

If you get five (5) consecutive warns in a two hour period, the server will automatically ban you for two hours.

 
The system logs your warns, so staff members are able to better judge a situation and deal appropriate punishment for constant rule breaking.

 
If you get too many warnings overall you will be dealt a different set of punishments.

 
If you get 20 total warns you will be banned for one (1) day.

If you get 45 total warns you will be banned for three (3) day.

If you get 60 total warns you will be banned for one (1) week.

If you get 75 total warns you will be banned for one (1) month.

If you somehow get 100 total warns you will PERMANENTLY banned.

You can have 3 fading doors

 
You may not have a Blackout Bases. This is a base that is made with one color with the intent to cause the raiding player to become distorted and unable to start or finish the raid if you have one you will be asked to fix it and the raid will continue, if you fail to do so the staff will delete portions of your base to allow the player to finish the raid..

 
You may not have maze bases.

 
You may not have a crouch, jump or parkour base.

 
You may not have a head glitch base.

 
You CANNOT have a kill box, i.e. having a base just for the pure intention of killing players via leaving your door open, offering free stuff and then killing them, etc. You will be punished the same as RDM, or even Mass RDM.

 
Skybases are allowed, but MUST have a clear way to get up and MUST follow all other basing rules. You may not have a Skybase for the pure intention of causing lag (via using materials that have constant moving/color changes. You may not have a fading door on your ramp, and you may not have trapped areas to the skybase.

 
One way props are allowed.

 
Buttons are allowed, but you are not allowed to use them for traps.

 
You may have a building sign to prevent you from being raided, kidnapped, mugged, or satan is here'd while you are in your base. HOWEVER you may not have ANY money making entities (includes meth, opium, bitminers, bitracks, printers, etc.) in your base, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT ACTIVELY MAKING MONEY!

 
You must also be building to have the building sign up (duh), leaving up building signs for a prolonged is UNACCEPTABLE.

 
Anyone basing with you must be added to ALL the doors or they will not be considered active residents of the base, meaning they are not allowed to defend the base unless they counter.

 
Anyone inside your base that you did not allow is KOS by default. HOWEVER, You may NOT have a base just just to wait for people to come in so you can kill them. This is considered a kill box.

 
ALL bases must be able to be lock picked AND keypad cracked or keycard hacked.

 
This means you CANNOT have two props stacked on top of eachother!

 
Builder rank is allowed to build anything, everywhere, as long as it is not breaking rules. This includes cars!

 
                                              Section 3 - Police Rules

 
Civil protection and the Mayor are allowed to build inside of PD to fortify/protect the mayor against raids. But it MUST follow all section 2 rules.

 
Civil protection and the Mayor may have bitminers and oil in the PD.

 
Civil protection may put bail to unarrest people, but the limit is two thousand.

 
Civil protection are not allowed to base, unless with the mayor to protect him.

 

You act according to the server rules and the laws made by the mayor, not what the mayor tells you to do.

You cannot kill someone for stunsticking you. If someone is abusing their stun stick, report it.

Warrants may be placed upon a person if you cannot get access to them (i.e. they're hiding in a base). You may also re-issue warrants when leaving a base if the current warrant expires.

You actually have to see them break the law to place the warrant, failing to do so counts as Metagaming and will be punished as FailRP .

The Battering Ram should ONLY be used for making an entrance to the base, NOT unfreezing unnecessary props. Abuse / unnecessary overuse of the battering ram counts as FailRP
